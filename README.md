# Drupal project generator

This tool simplifies the creation of Drupal projects by automating the setup process. With just a few steps, you can have a fully functional Drupal project up and running.

## Usage

To create a new project, follow these steps:

- Install [Lando](https://docs.lando.dev/install).
- Update the `setup.sh` file with the correct project name, Drupal version, and other project-specific details.
- Run the following command:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Sit back and relax as the script handles the rest, setting up your Drupal project automatically.
